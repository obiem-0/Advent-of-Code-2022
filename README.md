Advent of Code is **an annual coding challenge that takes place in December.** Each day, a new coding problem is released, and participants have to solve it using programming languages of their choice.

**Solving the these challenges demonstrates problem-solving and coding skills, as well as an good understanding of algorithms and data structures.** The challenges can range from relatively easy to highly complex, and they cover various topics, including math, cryptography, and graph theory.

**I've been able to improve my coding skills, learn new programming techniques (and found it's easier to find the solution in some languages than others),** and enjoyed working on the puzzles.
